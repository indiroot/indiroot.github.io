      <description>In this very brief article, a few definitions and demographic data on the indigenous people residing in Canada is presented.
Introduction In Canada, the term Indigenous people (or Aboriginal people) refers to First Nations (Indians), MÃ©tis, and Inuit people. These are the original inhabitants of the land that is now Canada. The Inuit primarily inhabit the northern regions of Canada. Their homeland, known as Inuit Nunangat, includes much of the land, water, and ice contained in the Arctic region.</description>
