      <description>First Nation, Métis, and Inuit religions in Canada vary widely and consist of complex social and cultural customs for addressing the sacred and the supernatural. The influence of Christianity  through settlers, missionaries, and government policy  significantly altered life for Indigenous peoples. In some communities, this resulted in hybridized religious practices; while in others, European religion replaced traditional spiritual practices entirely. Though historically suppressed by colonial administrators and missionaries, especially from the late 19th- to mid-20th centuries, many contemporary Indigenous communities have revived, or continue to practice, traditional spirituality.</description>

      <description>Indigenous peoples, both historical and contemporary, in North America can be divided into 10 cultural areas. Only the first six areas are found within the borders of Canada:
 Arctic Subarctic Northwest Coast Plateau Plains Eastern Woodlands (sometimes referred to as the Northeast) Southeast Southwest Great Basin California  Contemporary political borders in North America do not reflect (and often overlap) traditional lands. For example, the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne straddles both provincial (Québec and Ontario) and international (New York State) borders, as its existence predates the establishment of the international border in 1783.</description>

      <description>In this very brief article, a few definitions and demographic data on the indigenous people residing in Canada is presented.
Introduction In Canada, the term Indigenous people (or Aboriginal people) refers to First Nations (Indians), Métis, and Inuit people. These are the original inhabitants of the land that is now Canada. The Inuit primarily inhabit the northern regions of Canada. Their homeland, known as Inuit Nunangat, includes much of the land, water, and ice contained in the Arctic region.</description>
